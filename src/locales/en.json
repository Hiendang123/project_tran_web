    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Who should install the device and are there specific wiring instructions?",
        "answer": "The installation and operation of the product must be performed by a professional electrician. The phase wire cannot be reversed, and the ground wire must be connected correctly to avoid burning the device. Wires at the input-output terminals must be securely connected with screws."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if the device is wired incorrectly?",
        "answer": "Faulty wiring will burn the device and is not covered by the warranty. If the user wires it incorrectly, leading to an electric shock, the device is not within the warranty scope. If screws are not tightened securely, it can cause a short circuit and generate heat due to poor contact."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any environmental restrictions for installation?",
        "answer": "The device cannot be used in seawater or liquids with other dissolved organic substances. It is not waterproof, so it cannot be installed outdoors or in places prone to flooding."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the protection limitations of this device?",
        "answer": "The device only protects the output; the input is not within the scope of protection. It also only protects the power line itself, not the final electrical equipment connected to it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is grounding required for the device to work effectively?",
        "answer": "The device works best when it is grounded."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I connect the device to a computer?",
        "answer": "The product's RS485 is a standard communication port that can be connected to a computer via an RS485 to USB converter for information exchange and control. The default baud rate is 9600bps, which you can view and set on the computer."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main safety warnings for users?",
        "answer": "Do not hold a power wire with one hand and touch a grounded metal with the other. Also, do not touch the phase and neutral wires at the same time, as this will create a strong electric shock, though self-release is possible. Remember, this device is a preventive measure and does not permit operating electricity against regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the device protect against lightning?",
        "answer": "The device does not have inherent lightning protection. However, it can cut off conducted lightning surges and will redirect the current down the ground wire."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the water immersion protection work?",
        "answer": "Water immersion protection is only effective if the water is isolated from the ground or PE. If a person touches a phase wire while grounded, a leakage current may cause a shock sensation, but the person can self-release from the source."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does this device help prevent fires?",
        "answer": "Yes, the device minimizes the risk of electrical fires and explosions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the device save energy?",
        "answer": "The device saves energy by alerting and cutting off power when it detects an electrical leakage incident."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can the product be customized?",
        "answer": "Yes, this product can be customized according to user needs. Please contact the relevant technical department staff for assistance."
